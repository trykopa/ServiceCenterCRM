# ServiceCenterCRM v0.95

Hello, my name is Oleksandr Trykopa i'm junior Java Developer.
I am glad to present you my first project - CRM for a repair service center.

This project is the thesis for the completion of the Java Pro course - **"Prog.kiev.ua"**. 
I used the following technology stack:

* Spring IoC
* Spring MVC
* Spring Security
* Spring Data
* Spring Boot
* Spring Mail
* Lombok
* JPA / Hibernate
* AWS Java SDK
* MapStruct
* Thymeleaf


A working version of the project can be found at
https://servicecenter-crm.herokuapp.com
>For authorization, you can use the credentials:
>
>login: guest@test.com
>
>password: guest123

More options are available to users with administrator rights, 
which I can provide at your request.

*I would be glad to see the proposed changes or messages about the defects found.*
